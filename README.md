# Plans/Ideas for Project:

Front end:
Place for managers to place orders
-	Identify (choose) which area the order is from (donuts, grill, sodas, etc.)
-	Identify (choose) which store date the order is for 
-	Item
-	Measurement unit
-	Quantity

    Could include data showing what was ordered last time


Receiving end (inventory manager):
-	Place to check/enter remaining inventory (items, units, quantities) after one store is completed
-	Report of orders by area   (items, units, quantities)
-	Aggregate report of what needs to be ordered  (requests – inventory)
o	Ability for inventory manager to identify which grocery list to put items on (cafo, arcade, etc.)
-	Place to enter new inventory quantities
-	Ability for inventory manager to add new items to the system
o	Item, different types of units, price (at a chosen unit)
o	Ability to remove old items never needed again

Other dream features:
-	A module where managers could enter ingredients/quantities for a specific recipe and the total cost would be calculated for that recipe.
-	After store, a report of what item/ingredient quantities were used  (aggregate, not by area)
o	Also an expense sheet to go with it…expense by item and total expense
-	Ability to print out an inventory checklist (List of items for the inventory manager to write down quantities of each item in inventory, preferably with the ability to sort items by food items vs. non-perishables before printing.)
