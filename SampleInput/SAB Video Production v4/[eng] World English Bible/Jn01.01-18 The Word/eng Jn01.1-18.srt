1
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,560
In the beginning was the Word,

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,680
and the Word was with God,

3
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,720
and the Word was God.

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,400
The same was in the beginning with God.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,440
All things were made through him.

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,960
Without him,

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,360
nothing was made that has been made.

8
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,840
In him was life,

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,560
and the life was the light of men.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,320
The light shines in the darkness,

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,120
and the darkness hasn’t overcome it.

12
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:31,600
There came a man sent from God,

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,480
whose name was John.

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,080
The same came as a witness,

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,240
that he might testify about the light,

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:40,000
that all might believe through him.

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,340
He was not the light,

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,200
but was sent that he might testify about the light.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,840
The true light that enlightens everyone was coming into the world.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,840
He was in the world,

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,920
and the world was made through him,

22
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,600
and the world didn’t recognize him.

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,040
He came to his own,

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:59,920
and those who were his own didn’t receive him.

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,180
But as many as received him,

26
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:05,080
to them he gave the right to become God’s children,

27
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,560
to those who believe in his name:

28
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,280
who were born,

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,160
not of blood,

30
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,840
nor of the will of the flesh,

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
nor of the will of man,

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,040
but of God.

33
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,920
The Word became flesh and lived among us.

34
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,360
We saw his glory,

35
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,200
such glory as of the only born Son of the Father,

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,800
full of grace and truth.

37
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,640
John testified about him.

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,800
He cried out,

39
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,440
saying,

40
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,720
“This was he of whom I said,

41
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,400
‘He who comes after me has surpassed me,

42
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,720
for he was before me.’”

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,000
From his fullness we all received grace upon grace.

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,820
For the law was given through Moses.

45
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,600
Grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.

46
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,780
No one has seen God at any time.

47
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,400
The only born Son,

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,200
who is in the bosom of the Father,

49
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,960
has declared him.
